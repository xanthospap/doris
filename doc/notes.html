<h2>DORIS RINEX</h2>
<hr>

<h3>General</h3>
<hr>
<p>Depending on the version of the RINEX ﬁle, this receiver clock oﬀset can be either computed on-board 
by the DORIS-DIODE or through a post-processing performed with a software
called "PANDOR". In the ﬁrst case (DIODE time-tagging) the ﬁle names end with 
".001", in the second casev(PANDOR time-tagging) they end with ".010" on the IDS
Data Centers. The only diﬀerences between the two versions are the value of thev
\( \tau_{r_offset} \) ﬁeld and the label of the "OBSERVER" ﬁeld in the header: 
"STILO_" for DIODE, "PANDOR" for PANDOR [<a href="#lemoine_2016">1</a>].

<h3>RINEX HEADER</h3>
<hr>

<h4>L2/L1 DATE OFFSET</h4>
<p>This parameter gives the delay between:
<ul>
  <li>L1 measurement time : 2GHz phase sampling</li>
  <li>And L2 measurement time : 400MHz phase sampling</li>
</ul>
This delay is due to the independence of the two sampling scales. Both sampling scales have an
elementary schedule of 4 microseconds. This means that this delay is between 0 and 4
microseconds. It is measured by the instrument and updated for each RINEX file.</p>

<p id="phases_note"><sup>1</sup> Note: these phases are equal to the phases measured by the DORIS instrument with the opposite sign.</p>

<h4>Data Sequencing</h4>
<hr>
<p>As already mentioned, there can be two sets of measurements in sequences of 10 seconds,
the first at T0, the second at T0 + 3s. The dates introduced by the ">" sign therefore indicate
alternately the date of the first series of a sequence and then the date of the second series of the
same sequence. In the file given as an example, it must therefore be read:<br>
Record block 1: first measurements set of the first sequence<br>
Record block 2: second measurement set of the first sequence<br></p>

<p>It should be noted that both series are not always present. In particular at the start of a pass or
following a stall due to Doppler collision, the first series (phase measurements at T0) is absent
because of the time the receiver takes to lock on (or reconnect to) the signal. In this case, the first
step in the sequence will be at T0 + 3s.</p>

<h4>(ANN 1) RINEX Header Epoch</h4>
<hr>
<p>The date (for example: <pre>> 2012 02 26 00 00 27.359947870</pre>) is expressed in the onboard (BT)
scale. To convert it to the TAI scale, just add the given offset in seconds on the same line, after the
indicator of the number of measurements.</p>

<p>Example:
<pre>> 2012 02 26 00 00 27.359947870 0 2     1.497442592 0</pre>
TAI date of the measurements = 2012 02 26 00 00 27.3599 + 1.49744259247870 = 2012 02 26 00 00
28.857390462</p>

<p>It should be noted that the first series of measurements in the sequence falls nominally on a TAI date
whose modulo [10 seconds] = ~ -1.15 seconds (a value better known by the name of nominal time
shift between onboard and ground time frame).</p>

<p>The flag that follows the offset ("0" in the example above) indicates whether the offset for
correspondence between BT and TAI is derived from an interpolation ("0") or an extrapolation ("1"). It
is usually "0" and can be ignored (it does not affect the accuracy of the dating in TAI, which is always,
and regardless of the method used, to about the nearest microsecond, as this error is dominated by
the noise of the measurement of pseudo-range).</p>

<p><u>Summary</u>Thefirst part of the date (year, month, day, hour, minute, sec-ond) is given in the on-board time scale (proper time of theinstrument), and the conversion to the TAI time scale isobtained by adding the field containing the receiver clock-offset.</p>

<h4>Data Accuracy</h4>
<hr>
<p>In DORIS RINEX, two dual-frequency phase measurements are delivered every 10 seconds: the first
at T0, the second at T0 + ~3s. This may be of interest to those who want faster temporal sampling than 1 every 10 seconds.</p>

<p>In RINEX, the measurements are dated to a few microseconds in the TAI scale. This avoids the need
for users to repeat a BT/UT match.</p>

<p>The DORIS measurement of pseudo-range is not very accurate ~1km at 400MHz and ~5km at 2GHz.
The phase measurement is more accurate.</p>

<p>Phase measurement is accurate to a few millimetres.</p>

<h2>Observables</h2>

<h3>Phase Observables</h3>
<hr>
<p>Phase measurement definition, in meters :
\begin{equation}
\label{p-def}
\begin{split}
Q& = \lambda * \Phi_{re} \\
&= \lambda * ( \Phi_r - \Phi_e ) + u_Q
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where:
<ul>
  <li>\( \Phi_{re} \) is the rinex phase measurement in cycles (L1 or L2 in the Rinex 
    file). It is the difference between the receiver reference phase \( \Phi_r \) 
    and the phase of the received  signal, which was \( \Phi_e \) at the emission event.</li>
  <li>\( \lambda = c / f \) where \( f \) is the reference frequency for the considered 
    frequency band (coefficient to convert the oscillator cycle count in receiver time). This 
    is different from the ’true’ frequency of the oscillator. For Doris, f has values 401.25 
    or 2036.25 MHz.</li>
  <li>\( u_Q \) is the phase measurement error, the phase measurement noise is a few 
    millimeters.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Phase measurement modelling, in meters :
\begin{equation}
\label{p-mod}
\begin{split}
Q& = c (( \tau_r + h_r) - ( \tau_e + h_e ) ) + Q_0\\
& = c(t_r - t_e) + c( {\delta_r}^{rel} - {\delta_e}^{rel}) + c(h_r - h_e) + Q_0\\
& = D_{\Phi}(t_r) + c( {\delta_r}^{rel} - {\delta_e}^{rel}) + c(h_r - h_e) + Q_0 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where:
<ul>
  <li>\( \tau_r \) is the proper time for the receiver, and</li>
  <li>\( \tau_e \) is the proper time for the transmitter</li>
  <li>\( h_r \) is the receiver clock offset (usually it is modelled in Doris as a 
    polynomial expression in \( \tau_r \) ). The receiver clock time for the reception 
    event is \( \tau_r + h_r \). The difference between \( \tau_r + h_r \) and 
    \( \Phi_r / f \) is just a bias by definition of the receiver clock. This is 
    also the case for the difference between \( \tau_e + h_e \) and \( \Phi_e / f \).</li>
  <li>\( t \) is the coordinate time for the reception \( _r \) or emission events 
    \( _e \).<li>
  <li>\( \delta^{rel} \) is the difference between proper time and coordinate time 
    for the receiver or the transmitter, \( \tau = t + \delta^{rel} \). For the receiver 
    (on board the satellite), it is a frequency offset with added periodic terms. For the 
    transmitter (ground station), it is just a frequency offset. The corresponding 
    expressions are shown in the <a href="#appendix-1">appendix</a></li>
  <li>\( Q_0 \) is a common bias including the initial phase and a conventional time 
    offset which may be present in the definition of the clocks relative to the USOs phase.
    \( Q_0 \) remains constant for a visibility pass when the receiver phase measurement is 
    locked, it is different for each pass. In case of loss of lock during a pass, the value
    \( Q_0 \) changes by an integer number of wavelength \( \lambda \).</li>
  <li>\( D_{ \Phi }(t_r) \) is the propagation time for the phase measurement between the 
    transmitter and the receiver, expressed in meters, including atmospheric effects, 
    phase centre and phase maps corrections, phase windup and Shapiro effect. It is a 
    function of \( t_r \) (receiver coordinate time).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Pseudo-Range Observables</h3>
<hr>
<p>Pseudo-range measurement expression, in meters :
\begin{equation}
C = c(( \tau_r + h_r) - ( \tau_e + h_e )) + u_C
\end{equation}
where:
<ul>
  <li>\( \tau_r \) is the proper time for the receiver</li>
  <li>\( \tau_e \) is here the emission time (proper time) corresponding to the pseudo-range, 
    it is very close to the corresponding event for the phase.</li>
  <li>\( u_C \) is the pseudo-range measurement error (rms values have a magnitude of several
    hundred meters)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The corresponding modelling equation is:
\begin{equation}
C = D_C(t_r) + c({\delta_r}^{rel} - {\delta_e}^{rel}) + c(h_r - h_e) \label{r-mod}
\end{equation}
where:
<ul>
  <li>\( D_C(t_r) \) is the propagation time between the transmitter and the receiver, 
    expressed in meters, for the range measurement. It is a function of \( t_r \) 
    (receiver coordinate time). The main difference with \( D_{\Phi}(t_r) \) are the 
    ionospheric contribution (opposite sign) and the phase windup effect which is not 
    present for pseudo-range observables</li>
  <li>\( {\delta_e}^{rel} \) can be supposed identical for phase and pseudo-range. Also 
    \( h_e \) (which is a function of \( \tau_e \) is also supposed identical for phase and 
    pseudo-range</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In the equations \eqref{p-mode} and \eqref{r-mod} there is a contribution of the 
ionospheric effect different for each frequency. These contributions are removed by the 
’iono-free combination’ of the measurements and corresponding models.</p>

<h3>Dual frequency case, iono-free combination</h3>
<hr>
<p>The DORIS system uses two frequencies to remove the first order ionospheric effect, 
using an iono-free combination of the measurements (pseudo-range or phase).</p>

<p>For this dual frequency combination (iono-free combination), the model equations are 
similar. The values of \( \tau_r \) and \( t_r \) are all identical for the two frequencies 
(the receiver processing is designed for synchronous measurements). So the values of 
\( {\delta_r}^{rel} \) and \( h_r \) are identical. For the ground transmitter, the corresponding 
emission events are not exactly synchronous for the two frequencies, but the values of 
\( h_e \) and \( {\delta_e}^{rel} \) can be considered identical for phase and pseudo-range on both 
frequencies. For the geometry (iono-free \( D_C \) and \( D_{\Phi} \) ), if we suppose a 
100 m differential effect due to ionosphere, this produces a maximal error in the corresponding emission 
positions of 0.2 mm, which is negligible.</p>

<p>For the iono-free combination, we have, with \( D_C \) or \( D_{\Phi} \) corresponding 
to the iono-free propagations (no iono effect and use of iono-free reference phase centres) and 
\( Q_0 \) including now all possible hardware biases (inter-frequency biases):<br>
Pseudo_range
\begin{equation}
C = D_C(t_r) + c( {\delta_r}^{rel} - {\delta_e}^{rel} ) + c( h_r - h_e ) \label{if-r-mod}
\end{equation}
Phase
\begin{equation}
Q = D_{\Phi}(t_r) + c( {\delta_r}^{rel} - {\delta_e}^{rel} ) + c( h_r - h_e ) + Q_0 \label{if-p-mod}
\end{equation}
The minimal measurement set to be used in the Rinex file is the receiver time \( \tau_r + h_r \) 
and the corresponding iono-free combinations \( C \) obtained from \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) 
and \( Q \) obtained from \( \lambda_1 L_1 \) and \( \lambda_2 L_2 \).
</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
This model is valid only for the beacons without \( K \) frequency factor. The case of shifted 
frequency beacons is detailed in the appendix.
</div>

<p>Other data like the clock offset present at the end of the Rinex epoch header (this value 
corresponds to \( h_r + {\delta_r}^{rel} \), due to the synchronisation equations used for pseudo-range 
\( C \), which do not have any relativity correction term), or the onboard frequency, are 
obtained by the DIODE navigator, or by the ground post processing. This implies that some 
systematic errors or incosistencies amy occur when using these data. However, these data are 
useful for simplified solutions, or for validation purposes.</p>

<h2>Reception Coordinate Time \( t_r \)</h2>
<hr>
<p>For a given trajectory of a satellite, expressed in coordinate time, the objective is here 
to model correctly the phase measurement \( D_{\Phi}(t_r) \), knowing the values of 
\( \tau_r + h_r \), \( C \) and \( Q \). So we have to estimate \( t_r \) with a precision 
allowing a submillimeter modelling (better than \( 10^{-7} \) m.</p>

<p>\( h_r \) can only be observed with pseudorange measurements. Due to the important noise 
of the pseudorange observations \( C \), it is necessary to use a model for \( h_r \), 
a snapshot solution is not realistic. Another reason is that for standard beacons (\(h_e = 0 \) 
after correction with the bias and drift given in the RINEX file header) and these beacons are 
not in permanent visibility. For the time beacons, the relativity correction \( {\delta_e}^{rel} \) 
must be set to \(0\).</p>

<p>The pseudo range equations \eqref{if-r-mod} and \eqref{if-p-mod} can be solved using a 
polynomial expression in \( \tau_r \) for \( h_r \), and a sufficient number of passes on 
reference beacons (typically more than two days are used, and a second degree polynomial). 
Due to the almost linear evolution between \( \tau_r \) and \( t_r \), the polynomial is 
usually expressed in \( t_r \) to simplify the coefficients identification.</p>

<p>It is important to notice that in the usual Doris solutions, the term \( {\delta_r}^{rel} \) 
is not used in the pseudo-range equation. This term has a very important drift (frequency bias), and 
small periodic variations (a few centimeters). The periodic variations contributions are 
negligible for the reception time estimation. However the drift is not negligible and will 
be absorbed in this case by the adjusted polynomial. This means that in this case, for 
the phase processing, the relativistic correction \( {\delta_r}^{rel} \) must be adapted to 
have no drift (like in GPS processing, where only the periodic terms are used in the GPS satellite 
clock correction).</p>

<h2>Phase Modelling \( Q \)</h2>
<hr>
<p>Now, knowing the on board clock offset \( h_r \) for all reception epochs \( t_r \), it is possible to
use the phase equation \eqref{if-p-mod}, where the only remaining measurement unknown parameters
are \( h_e \) and \( Q_0 \) apart from other parameters like zenith troposphere delays or satellite
orbit parameters which contribute to \( D_{\Phi}(t_r) \) and will be adjusted in a global solution.
To obtain information from this equation it is necessary to model \( h_e \) in a certain way,
for example by adding constraints between successive epochs. In standard Doris Doppler 
processing, the beacon frequencies (or frequencies and drifts) are assumed to be
constant during a pass, and are adjusted per pass. For the phase equation this corresponds to 
adjust a 1 or 2 degree polynomial function of \( \tau_e \) (or \( t_e \) ) to represent \( h_e \) . 
This was not clearly detailed in [2], the beacon polynomial is defined as a function of \( t_r \) ,
which leads to significative errors in station positioning when the beacon frequency bias
is important.</p>

<p>For the relativistic corrections, the transmitter correction \( {\delta_e}^{rel} \) is a bias 
and a drift (the beacon is fixed on the ground), and is not seperable from the \( h_e \) 
polynomial expression. It can be corrected a-priori, but this is not necessary.</p>

<p>The receiver correction is also mainly a bias and a drift, which cannot be seperated from the 
polynomial expression of \( h_r \) as explained above. The periodic terms (due to eccentricity 
and \( J_2 \) contributions) can be modelled. In current DORIS POD solutions, they are set to \( 0 \) 
(millimeter radial effect on the orbits), but are probably not negligible for station positioning.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><u>Remark</u>: in the DORIS 2.2. measurement files, these relativistic periodic terms
are not taken into account, the on board frequency (derivative of \( h_r \), or increments of
successives values of \(h_r\) ) is the only modelled term, as a low degree polynomial. This
was not a problem at the beginning of Doris, but this approach has to be improved,
as for satellites like Cryosat, the complete clock relativistic periodic bias amplitude
contribution can reach 10 centimeters.</p>
</div>

<p>Of course, it is also possible to write directly the phase increments equations in Doppler
mode (as it is the case for the standard DORIS Doppler processing). The same properties 
hold for \(t_r\), \(t_e\), and for the related mean frequencies obtained with the \(h_e\) 
and \(h_r\) variations.</p>

<h3 id="appendix-1">Equations for Shifted Frequency Beacons</h3>
<hr>
<p>The frequency shift is defined by an integer value \(K\), given in the RINEX header [1].
This means that the nominal reference frequency of the beacon is shifted from the
standard system frequency, and can be written as \(f_K = (1 + a_K )f \) with \(f\) the nominal
frequency.</p>

<p>The transmission time is constructed using the correct time evolution (that is, is exactly
equivalent to the one obtained with a \(K = 0\) beacon, driven by the same oscillator).</p>

<p>However, this is not the case for the phase measurement, which follows the same mea-
surement equation expressed in cycles as the other beacons (\eqref{p-def}). In order to be
able to process these measurements in the same way as the standard case (\(K = 0\)), the
corrected cycle count \(Q_{corr}\) (in meters) corresponding to the model \eqref{p-mod} would
be, with the shifted wavelength \( \lambda_K = c / f_K \):
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Q_{corr}& = \lambda \Phi_r - \lambda_K \Phi_e \\
& = \lambda_K ( \Phi_r - \Phi_e ) + ( \lambda - \lambda_K ) \Phi_r \\
& = \lambda_K ( \Phi_r - \Phi_e ) + c \frac{\Phi_r}{f} \frac{a_K}{1+a_K}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The term \(\frac{\Phi_r}{f}\) is proportional to the measured reception time \( tau_r + h_r \), 
which is directly the receiver measurement time present in the RINEX file. Using this corrected 
\(Q_{corr}\) expression for the phase measurement, the shifted frequency beacons can be processed 
in the same way as all the other beacons.</p>
