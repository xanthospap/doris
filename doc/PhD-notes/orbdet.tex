\chapter{Orbit Determination using DORIS \& Extended Kalman Filter}

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item we are going to use the symbol $t$ to denote time epochs in the 
    TAI time-scale
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Parse the input DORIS RINEX file and get the first epoch, $t_{R_0}$

  \item Parse the input Sp3 file; get the state vector for the epoch $t_0$, 
    closest to but not exceeding $t_{R_0}$

  \item Use the integrator to extrapolate the state vector from $t_0$ to 
    $t_{R_0}$. We now have the state at $t_{R_0}$, aka $\bm{y}(t=t_{R_0})$

  \item Iterate through the RINEX measurements for the instant $t_{R_0}$; 
    for each beacon, construct the observation equation if a previous 
    observation exists, or store measurement info, if this is the first 
    encounter with the beacon (no Doppler count available)

  \item For each beacon that we have Doppler count (and hence can form the 
    observation equation), procced to filtering. The parameters estimated are:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \\ 
        v_x \\ v_y \\ v_z 
        \\ C_{drag}
        \\ L_{b1}^{wet} \\ \frac{\Delta f_0}{f_{e_{b1}}}
        \\ L_{b2}^{wet} \\ \frac{\Delta f_0}{f_{e_{b2}}}
        \\ vdots 
      \end{pmatrix}
    \end{equation}

\end{enumerate}
