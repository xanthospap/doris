\section{Dependencies}
\begin{description}
    \item [libcurl] a free, and open-source multiprotocol file transfer library.
    \href{https://curl.se/libcurl/}{libcurl} is highly portable, it builds and works 
    identically on numerous platforms and provides a \href{https://curl.se/libcurl/c/}{C API}, 
    accessing remote files via the C/C++ programming languages. Installation is 
    trivial in most operating systems\footnote{E.g. for Fedora LInux: \lstinline[language=bash]|$ dnf install libcurl libcurl-devel|}.
    
    \item [Eigen] (\cite{eigenweb}) a free, and open-source C++ template library 
    for linear algebra. 
    \href{https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page}{Eigen} is a 
    versatile, fast and reliable library, with no dependencies other than the 
    C++ standard library. Since it is a header-only library, ``installation'' 
    and inclusion is very easy for any platform.

    \item [cgem] a free, and open-source C++ library. 
    \href{https://www.kthohr.com/gcem.html}{cgem} offers compile-time 
    computation of a number of widely used mathematical function, see
    \ref{sec:constexpr-math}

\section{Constexpr Math}
\label{sec:constexpr-math}
Currently (\today), the standard C++ library \texttt{math.h} does not offar 
trigonometric mathematical functions qualified as \texttt{constexpr} (see 
\href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cmath}{Standard library header \texttt{<cmath>}}).
\texttt{constexpr} functions can spped-up computations by performing them at 
compile-time (see 
\href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr}{\texttt{constexpr} keyword}). 
The \href{https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/}{GNU C++ Library} 
implementation \texttt{libstdc++} does offer such functions as an extension. It 
was however decided to not use these extensions, because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item they do not conform to the standard,
    \item we want to be able to build with any compiler and standard library implementation
\end{itemize}

Hence, we are using the \href{https://www.kthohr.com/gcem.html}{Generalized Constant Expression Math} 
(\texttt{gsem}) library, when such functionality is needed.

It is expected that in the near future, most of the standard mathematical 
functions will be marked/implemented as \texttt{constexpr} (\cite{rostencpp}). 
When such functionality is offered, the dependency on \texttt{gcem} should be 
dropped in favor of using the standard functions.
