Geodesy has greatly advanced since the introduction of artificial, Earth orbiting
satellites. A new era has emerged, where satellite-based data dominate the field,
providing results for a wide range of geodesy-related fields, including but not
limited to positioning, reference frames, altimetry and gravity field determination.

The use of artificial satellites in geosciences however requires
a comprehensive knowledge of the satellite motion under
the influence of all acting forces as well as the description of the satellite
trajectory and ground stations in suitable reference frames, both spatial and
temporal. Thus exploitation of satellite-based observations is inherently
coupled with the complex problem of orbit determination, a problem that lies in
the core of satellite geodesy since its inception.

To-date, \gls{pod} is dominated by three space geodetic techniques, namely \gls{slr}, \gls{gnss} and
\gls{doris}, which additionally, via the corresponding Technique Centers, provide the input
data time series of station positions and \gls{eop} for the realization of the \gls{itrf}
. Along with \gls{vlbi}, these
techniques constitute the fundamental pillars of modern satellite geodesy.

\gls{doris} has played a crucial role in expanding geodetic knowledge and enhancing
our understanding of the Earth's dynamics and is anticipated to continue to enhance
its significant role through endeavors such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography
(SWOT) and GENESIS missions.

Despite the \gls{doris} prominence and significance in the field of satellite geodesy,
it has failed to allure a dedicated scientific audience comparable in size to
the other techniques. The shortage of dedicated \gls{ids} analysis centers,
is indicative of the limited availability of dedicated software solutions designed to
handle \gls{doris} data, particularly for the purpose of orbit determination.

In the framework of the current Thesis, the scarcity of dedicated \gls{doris}
analysis tools for orbit determination is targeted, with the aim of creating
a high quality, scientific software solution.

Given the complexity of the problem and the inherent limitations of a thesis, both in
terms of time and resources, the objective of the current study is not to attain the
highest possible accuracy achievable by the \gls{ids} Analysis Centers. Instead, the
focus is on developing a brand-new toolset from scratch, which can serve as a
foundational component towards achieving that goal. The envisioned toolset, with
some additional fine refinements, has the potential to form the backbone of a
state-of-the-art, \gls{doris} \gls{pod} analysis pipeline.

Using the toolset developed, an orbit determination analysis scheme was designed and
tested using the \gls{jason}-3 satellite mission, using a high quality reference orbit
for validation. Position differences ranges within a few meters for one day, while
velocity discrepancies are in the order of a few millimeters per second. These results show
that the software package developed can serve as a building block for a high quality
\gls{doris} analysis software solution.
