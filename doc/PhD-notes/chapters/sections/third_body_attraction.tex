\subsubsection{Third Body Attraction}\label{sssec:third-body-perturbations}

The presence of other bodies in the gravitational field exerted by a main central
body (Earth), makes the problem of orbit determination a $N$-body problem, which however, 
as known, cannot be solved analytically. In the case of artificial satellites orbiting 
the Earth at low altitudes, the gravitational force due to the Earth is by far larger 
than those exerted by the Moon, Sun or planets. Therefore, the problem can be solved 
by using the methods of perturbation theory. In this approach, the computation of the 
perturbing acceleration can be simplified when considering the third or \emph{perturbing body} 
as a point mass. Third body perturbing acceleration from Sun and Moon, are often 
called \emph{Direct Tides}.

Introducing vectors $\bm{r}$ and $\bm{s}$, to describe the geocentric coordinates 
of the satellite and the third-body respectively, then according to Newton's law, 
the acceleration of the satellite by the third-body (or \emph{perturbing body}), 
considered as a point mass, is (the subscript $pb$ denotes the perturbing body)
\begin{equation}
    \bm{\ddot{r}} = GM_{pb} \frac{\bm{s}-\bm{r}}
        {\norm{\bm{s}-\bm{r}}^3}
\end{equation}
where Earth's acceleration due to the perturbing body should also be account for, 
hence
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mont337}
    \bm{\ddot{r}} = GM_{pb} \left( 
        \frac{\bm{s}-\bm{r}}{\norm{\bm{s}-\bm{r}}^3} 
        - \frac{\bm{s}}{\norm{\bm{s}}^3} \right)
\end{equation}

For the current Thesis, we third body perturbations from Moon and Sun are considered. 
In a similar fashion using the software developed, third body attraction can be 
computed for all planets, though their effect can be safely neglected 
for \gls{leo} satellites.

\paragraph{\gls{jpl} Ephemerides}\label{par:jpl-ephemerides}

To compute third body perturbations, as evident from \autoref{eq:mont337}, 
coordinates of the perturbing bodies at a given instant $t$ need to be known. For high 
precision applications, Sun, Moon and planetary ephemerides are used and interpolated 
for the requested epoch.

\gls{jpl} Development Ephemeris (abbreviated \texttt{JPL DE(number)}) 
designates one of a series of mathematical models of the Solar System produced at the 
\href{https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/}{\gls{jpl}} for use in spacecraft navigation and astronomy. 
The models consist of numeric representations of positions, velocities and accelerations 
of major Solar System bodies, tabulated at equally spaced intervals of time, covering 
a specified span of years. Further information and a description of 
available ephemerides, can be found at the 
\href{https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/eph_export.html}{\gls{jpl} Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides} 
website.

For the purposes of this Thesis, software was developed to interact with the 
\gls{jpl} DE files, generic enough to handle all versions of the ephemerides. 
An interface to the \gls{jpl}-provided Observation Geometry System
for Space Science Missions (\href{https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/}{SPICE}) 
software library \footnote{Based on the C version of the 
\href{https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit_C.html}{Navigation and Ancillary Information Facilty (NAIF)}} 
was designed to extract Sun, Moon and planet coordinates, and respective constants. Tests and 
validation are performed using the \texttt{DE421} ephemerides (\cite{Folkner2009}).

\paragraph{Partial Derivatives of Third Body Perturbations}\label{par:third-body-perturbations-partials}

As can be shown from \autoref{eq:mont337}, the partial derivative of the third body 
perturbation w.r.t to the satellite state vector $\bm{x}=\begin{pmatrix}\bm{r} & \bm{v} \end{pmatrix}^T$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial \bm{\ddot{r}}}{\partial \bm{r}} &= 
      -GM_{pb} \left( \frac{1}{\norm{\bm{r}-\bm{s}}^3} \bm{I}_{3\times 3} 
      -3 \left(\bm{r}-\bm{s} \right) \frac{\left(\bm{r}-\bm{s} \right)^T}{\norm{\bm{r}-\bm{s}}^5}
      \right) \\
    \frac{\partial \bm{\ddot{r}}}{\partial \bm{v}} &= \bm{0}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Validation}\label{sssec:third-body-perurbation-validation}

To test our implementation, we checked our results against the \texttt{COST-G} 
benchmark test, considering third body perturbing accelerations both from Moon and Sun. 
Input data for the test is a one-day orbit arc of \gls{grace} in \gls{icrf} and 
the DE ephemeris file \texttt{DE421} (see \autoref{par:jpl-ephemerides}). 
The differences are depicted in \autoref{fig:directMoonTideIcrfVsCostg} and \autoref{fig:directSunTideIcrfVsCostg} 
and information is tabulated in \autoref{tab:directMoonTideIcrfVsCostg}.
\autoref{fig:directMoonTideIcrfVsCostg} and \autoref{fig:directSunTideIcrfVsCostg} reveal a 
harmonic behavior of the differences, but since the values are close to machine precision, 
no safe conclusion can be drawn.
