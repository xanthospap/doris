\section{The State Transition Matrix}\label{sec:state-transition-matrix}

The dynamics of an orbit determination problem, can in the general case be 
described by the 1\textsuperscript{st} order \gls{ode} system (see
\autoref{sec:integration-introduction})
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tapley421}
  \bm{\dot{y}} = \bm{f}(t, \bm{y})
\end{equation}
where $\bm{y}$ is the state vector and $f$ is a vector function.
