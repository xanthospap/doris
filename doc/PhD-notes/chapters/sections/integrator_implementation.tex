According to \cite{Shampine1975}, use of Adams methods are most advantageous for 
problems in which:
\begin{itemize}
    \item function evaluations are expensive,
    \item mnoderate to high accuracy is requested,
    \item many output points are required
\end{itemize}

\cite{Shampine1975}:
The overhead in these codes is rather high, partly because of the methods
and partly because of the features they provide. For example, DE detects
and deals with discontinuities; it detects and deals with moderate stiffness;
it detects and tells the user of severe stiffness; it detects requests for very
high accuracy and switches on propagated roundoff controls; it detects
requests for more accuracy than is possible on the machine being used and
tells the user what is possible; it is, for practical purposes, independent
of the number and location of output points; it monitors the work being
expended; it allows the user to change direction without restarting; and
it is extremely efficient in terms of function evaluations.
