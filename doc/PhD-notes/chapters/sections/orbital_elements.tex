\subsection{Orbital Elements}
\label{ssec:orbital-elements}

A total of six independent parameters are needed to unambiguously define an 
arbitrary and unperturbed orbit at some instant $t$ in time. Two parameters, 
eccentricity $e$ and angular momentum $h$ (or alternatively the semi-major axis, 
$\alpha$) define the form of the orbit. To locate a point on the orbit we need a 
third parameter, the true anomaly $\theta$. Describing the orientation of the 
orbit in three dimensions requires three additional parameters, inclination $i$, 
argument of perigee $\omega$ and right ascension of the ascending node, $\Omega$. 
These six parameters are called the \emph{orbital} or 
\emph{Keplerian elements}\footnote{There exist alternate sets of (six) parameters 
that can uniquely define the orbit, but this set is by far the most widely used 
in celestial mechanics.} (see \autoref{fig:orbital-elements-3d} and 
\autoref{fig:orbital-elements-Ooi}).
\begin{description}[labelindent=1cm]
  \item[$\alpha$]: the \emph{semi-major axis} (sometimes $h$, the specific 
    \emph{angular momentum} is used instead),
  \item[$i$]: \emph{inclination},
  \item[$\Omega$]: \emph{right ascension of the ascending node},
  \item[$e$]: \emph{eccentricity},
  \item[$\omega$]: \emph{argument of perigee},
  \item[$\theta$]\footnote{True anomaly is often designated with the letter 
    $\nu$ of $f$, but here we are following the notation $\theta$}.: 
    \emph{true anomaly} (sometimes $\bm{M}$, the \emph{mean anomaly} 
    is used instead)

$\Omega$, $\omega$ and $i$, which define the orientation of the orbit in space, 
are sometimes called \emph{Euler angles}. Given these six elements, it is always 
possible to uniquely calculate the \emph{state vector}, that is the three spatial 
dimensions defining the position $\begin{pmatrix}x&y&z\end{pmatrix}$ in a Cartesian 
coordinate system, and their corresponding velocities 
$\begin{pmatrix}\dot{x}&\dot{y}&\dot{z}\end{pmatrix}$.

A real orbit and its elements change over time due to various perturbations (see 
\autoref{ssec:perturbed-motion}). A Kepler orbit is an idealized, mathematical 
approximation of the orbit at a particular time. To avoid confusion, we are going 
to adopt the distinction of orbital elements sets proposed by \cite{Vallado} and 
distinguish between the following cases:
\begin{description}
  \item \emph{two-body elements} are the elements derived from or used with 
    the two-body equations of motion,
  \item \emph{osculating elements} are the \emph{instantaneous} elements, under 
    the influence of perturbations, and
  \item \emph{mean elements} are the elements obtained when averaging the 
    effect of perturbations over a specified time interval
\end{description}

Mathematical formulas to transform between state vector and orbital elements can 
be found in relevant literature. In the software developed for this Thesis, the 
methodology described in \cite{Montenbruck2000} is adopted and implemented.
