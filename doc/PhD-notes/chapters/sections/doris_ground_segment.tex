\subsection{Geometry of Ground Antennae}\label{ssec:antenae-geometry}
DORIS observations are referred to the electronic reference point (RP) of the 
antenna, the points where the DORIS observations  are  acquired.  As that 
electronic  point (\SI{2}{\GHz} center of phase for DORIS) is virtual and as 
for example it may change while using another type of antenna data referring 
to that electronic point are of no use for geophysical studies. So, 
observations must be referred to the conventional RP which is defined 
according to the geometry of the antenna. Therefore, one has also to account 
for the distance between the electronic RP and the conventional RP of the 
antenna (\cite{TOURAIN2016}). The ability to get accurate DORIS data relies 
for one part on the capability of providing accurate models to connect the 
electronic RP (or electronic phase center) and the conventional RP, as well 
as, phase center variations (\glspl{pcv}) as a function of the elevation angle 
and azimuth.

The type of antenna is identified by the 4\textsuperscript{th} character of 
the beacon mnemonic: letter ``A'' for the Alcatel type; letter ``B'' or letter 
``C'' for the Starec B or C type.  That is, in the DORIS RINEX field 
``STATION REFERENCE'', the last character of the second column (aka 
``4-character station code''), defines the ground beacon antenna type;

\subsubsection{Phase Center Offsets}\label{sssec:doris-pco}
Depending on the antenna type, appropriate \gls{pco}s need to be applied to 
the observed quantities for the reduction of the observation vector to the 
Reference Point (from the respective ``virtual'' phase center) of the antenna. 
When a linear combination of the observed quantities is used, a respective 
\gls{pco} needs to be computed and applied. E.g., for the case of the 
ionospheric-free linear combination, the respective \gls{pco} is:
\begin{equation}
    \vec{r}_{2GHz,iono-free} = \frac{\vec{r}_{400MHz,2GHz}}{\gamma - 1}
\end{equation}

where $\vec{r}_{2GHz,iono-free}$ is the vector from the \SI{2}{\GHz} phase
center to the iono-free phase center and $\vec{r}_{400MHz,2GHz}$ is
the vector from the \SI{400}{MHz} to the \SI{2}{\GHz} phase center.

\subsubsection{DORIS STAREC Antenna}\label{sssec:doris-starec}
STAREC antennae B and C are identical in terms of design and specification, the
difference is about the error budget in phase center position. For STAREC-C,
manufacturing process and error budget have been improved \cite{DORISGSM}.

According to \cite{TOURAIN2016}, in order to check the consistency of the theoretical 
characteristics of this type of antennae, a measurement campaign was performedby 
the \gls{cnes} at the \gls{catr}. The \gls{catr} is a dedicated facility 
consisting of an anechoic chamber equipped with several specific devices 
allowing significant measurement for satellite characterization.

As a result of the campaign, a phase law was established by averaging the 
estimated phase law values obtained during the \gls{catr} characterization. 
The resulting couple phase center positionâ€“phase law correction was provided 
to the DORIS users through a text file in \gls{antex} (\cite{ANTEXv14}) format, 
made available by \gls{ids} at 
\url{ftp://ftp.ids-doris.org/pub/ids/stations/doris_phase_law_antex_starec.txt}.

STAREC antennae B and C are identical in terms of design and specification, the
difference is about the error budget in phase center position. For STAREC C,
manufacturing process and error budget have been improved (\cite{DORISGSM}).
