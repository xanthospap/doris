Satellite Geodesy comprises the observational and computational techniques which allow
the solution of geodetic problems by the use of precise measurements to, from, or between
artificial, mostly near-Earth, satellites (\cite{Seeber2003}). Satellite geodesy began
shortly after the launch of the first artificial satellite, SPUTNIK-1, on October 4, 1957.
Observations of Explorer 1 and Sputnik 2 in 1958 allowed for an accurate determination of
Earth's flattening, one of the first results of the emerging Satellite Geodesy field. 
Latter missions led to the accurate determination of the leading
spherical harmonic coefficients of the geopotential, the general shape of the geoid,
and linked the world's geodetic datums (e.g. \cite{KingHele1958} and \cite{Merson1958}).
Further historical notes on the advancement of Satellite Geodesy can be found in literature 
(e.g. \cite{Seeber2003} and \cite{Barlier2001}).

A slight detour is in place here, in memory of the late pioneer in Satellite Geodesy, George Veis (1929-2022), 
Professor at the School of Rural, Surveying and Geoinformatics Engineering, of the National Technical 
University of Athens (NTUA). 
Professor Veis was one of the framers of the early Satellite Geodesy Program at the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), which itself was a fundamental element of
the early \gls{nasa} Space Geodesy Activity. He was awarded with his PhD in 1958,
after defending his famous dissertation on the "Geodetic Applications of Observations
of the Moon, Artificial Satellites and Rockets" (\cite{Veis1960}). He actively contributed the early
concept and evolution of the Differential Orbit Improvement (DOI) Program, which became
the main analysis tool for satellite tracking, geopotential estimation, station
coordinate determination, and satellite drag research. He defined the fundamental
reference system used for many years, which now forms the basis of modern models
of earth rotation, precession, and nutation. He also initiated the SAO Star Catalogue
project, which provided a uniform all-sky catalogue for precision camera observations,
and was used for many years all over the world\footnote{"\textit{The passing of Professor George Veis}",

Since the launch of the first artificial satellites, satellite geodesy has developed into a
self-contained field in geodetic teaching and research, with close relations and interactions 
with adjacent fields. 
Developments in space science and technology have spurred new interest
in the subject of the Earth's rotation, and geophysical knowledge of the Earth's interior has
undergone a very considerable revision leading to an improved understanding of the
geophysical excitation functions that perturb the Earth's rotation (\cite{Lambeck1980}).
By virtue of the ever increasing accuracy achieved by satellite geodesy,
its results and methods are used by or are connected to a wide range of disciplines, spanning
basic sciences, geosciences and engineering.

The use of artificial satellites in geodesy, has
some prerequisites though; these are basically a comprehensive knowledge of the satellite
motion under the influence of all acting forces as well as the description of the satellite
trajectory and ground stations in suitable reference frames, both spatial and temporal.
Thus, in the core of satellite geodesy lies the problem of orbit determination. Satellite
orbit determination is the process by which knowledge of the satellite’s
motion relative to the center of mass of the Earth in a specified coordinate system can be
obtained (\cite{Tapley2004}). Precise satellite orbits are a prerequisite for determining
reliable geodetic parameters, including but not limited to station coordinates, \gls{eop},
or coefficients of the Earth's gravity field. They are also fundamental for satellite-based
observations of geodynamics and climate impacts, such as sea level changes in the order of
millimeters. Realization and maintenance of global reference frames is also relied upon
\gls{pod}.

\gls{pod} analysis is a very challenging task, requiring multi-scientific expertise,
coupled with efficient engineering. Given the accuracy requirements today (especially
for altimetry missions on-board which \gls{doris} receivers are installed), the
ever growing number of scientific satellites missions, and the widening of the application
range (e.g. climate change studies), it constitutes a field of growing dynamics.
Earth orbiting artificial differ from most natural objects in that, due to their size, mass,
and orbit characteristics, the nongravitational forces are of significant importance.
Further, most satellites orbit near to the surface and for objects close to a central
body, the gravitational forces depart from a central force in a significant way
(\cite{Tapley2004}).

To-date, \gls{pod} is dominated by three space geodetic techniques, namely \gls{slr}, \gls{gnss} and
\gls{doris}, which additionally, via the corresponding Technique Centers, provide the input
data time series of station positions and \gls{eop} for the realization of the \gls{itrf}
\footnote{ITRF2020, \url{https://itrf.ign.fr/en/solutions/ITRF2020}}. Along with \gls{vlbi}, these
techniques constitute the fundamental pillars of modern satellite ans space geodesy.
State-of-the-art \gls{pod} analysis, can deliver accuracies in the centimeter level
(\cite{Rudenko2023}).

Since its inception in the late 1980s, \gls{doris} has  played a crucial role in expanding
geodetic knowledge and enhancing our understanding of the Earth’s dynamics and is currently
considered a pillar of satellite geodesy. However, despite its prominence and significance,
it has failed to allure a dedicated scientific audience comparable in size to the other two
techniques. For the most recent realization of \gls{itrf}, the \gls{ilrs} contributed data
from 7 Analysis Centers (\cite{Pavlis2023}), \gls{igs} from 10 (\cite{Rebischung2021}), while
at the same time the \gls{ids}'s contribution was derived from only 4 Analysis Centers
(\cite{Moreaux2022}). This shortage of dedicated \gls{ids} analysis centers, also reflects the
scarcity in dedicated software tools to process \gls{doris} data, first and foremost for
orbit determination.

In the framework of the current Thesis, this scarcity of dedicated \gls{doris}
analysis tools for orbit determination is targeted, with the aim of creating
a high quality, scientific software solution. Designing for extensibility, reusability
and adaptability, and adhering to a free and open source policy, an as large as possible
impact is sought for in the scientific community. Coupled with recent
advancements in the technique (e.g. adoption of the RINEX format, dissemination of
non-preprocessed data including carrier phase observables, introduction of next generation
receivers and beacons) all of which are incorporated in the software built, 
we hope to spur further, renewed interest in this fundamental area of satellite geodesy.

To accomplish this task, the software is built in a modular fashion. The various components
are organized in different, independent, moderate-sized libraries, targeting well defined
problems. This scheme allows for extensive and thorough testing and validation  of the different 
parts of the package, a vital part of modern software design (e.g. \cite{Oberkampf2010}, \cite{Meyer2008}).
Additionally, it enables customization according to user needs and accommodates  
extensibility and maintainability. The latter attributes are of major importance when 
aiming at an analysis tool reaching \gls{ids} accuracy demands, since such software packages 
are in an ever-lasting cycle of adopting the latest, most up-to-date scientific advancements.

State-of-the-art models and methodologies are used, adhering to the latest 
standards and recommendations (e.g. \cite{IdsRecommendationItrf2020}, \cite{iers2010}). 
Extensions and modifications are derived and applied where needed. Various different 
implementations are put to the test and robust algorithmic approaches are constructed 
based on criteria of accuracy and efficiency (computing speed and resources).

Implementation of such sophisticated and complex models is a challenging task. One that requires a 
rigorous understanding of the theoretical implications on the one hand, and robust 
engineering on the other. The path taken here, is to follow modern software design 
patterns, including principles of \emph{data-oriented} design (\cite{Fabian2018}), coupled with 
the well established \emph{object-oriented} pattern, while also taking advantage of 
modern features such as generic programming via \emph{template metaprogramming} 
(e.g. \cite{Gawlik2018}). Given that most scientific software packages were built 
a few decades back, this design constitutes a novel approach in software tools for 
the given problem set.

The layout of the Thesis, includes seven chapters. In the second chapter 
(\autoref{ch:fundamental-astrodynamics}), required concepts of 
fundamental astrodynamics are introduced. Perturbed satellite motion is discussed and 
state-of-the-art approaches for modeling perturbation forces acting on Earth orbiting 
satellites are presented along with implementation details. Spatial and temporal reference 
frames are then introduced, to efficiently describe orbital motion.

The next chapter (\autoref{ch:orbit-integration}) reviews orbit integration, focusing on 
numerical integration of orbital motion using the \emph{special perturbations} 
approach. An efficient yet robust integrator is derived, to be used in a \gls{pod} 
analysis scheme.

In Chapter four (\autoref{ch:pod}), an overview of \gls{pod} concepts is given, 
with special attention on the \emph{Extended Kalman Filter} and the linearization 
of the (non-linear) perturbed orbital trajectory model. Consequently, efficient 
representation and formulation of the \emph{variational equation} system is discussed, 
a fundamental yet complex problem for high accuracy orbit determination.

The \gls{doris} technique is introduced in Chapter five (\autoref{ch:doris}). 
The technique's principle is presented, along with the instrumentation used and 
details on the ground segment, including the tracking network. Derivation of the 
observation equation model, theoretical implications, error sources and mitigation are 
also discussed. Implementation details and considerations conclude this 
chapter.

Chapter six (\autoref{ch:pod-using-doris}) begins with a description of the 
software built for this Thesis. It then goes on to test and validate the tools built, 
using a real-world scenario with one day of \gls{doris} data acquired from the 
\gls{jason}-3 satellite mission. Results obtained are checked against high-quality 
reference results. Differences with respect to the reference solution are thoroughly 
examined and reasoned about.

The last Chapter (\autoref{ch:summary-and-recomend}) of the Thesis discusses 
conclusions drawn from the work performed and recommendations for further research 
activities and refinements of the software tools built.
