\section{The Extended Kalman Filter}\label{sec:pod-extended-kalman-filter}

Compared to the 

One disadvantage of both the batch and sequential algorithm lies in the fact
that if the true state and the reference state are not close together then the lin-
earization assumption leading to Eq. (4.2.6) may not be valid and the estimation
process may diverge
