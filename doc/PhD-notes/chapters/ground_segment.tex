\section{Geometry of Ground Antennae}
DORIS observations are referred to the electronic reference point (RP) of the antenna, 
the points where the DORIS observations  are  acquired.  As  that  electronic  point 
(\SI{2}{\GHz} center of phase for DORIS) is virtual and as for example it may change 
while using another type of antenna data referring to that electronic point are of no 
use for geophysical studies. So, observations must be referred to the conventional RP 
which is defined according to the geometry of the antenna. Therefore, one has also to 
account for the distance between the electronic RP and the conventional RP of the antenna (\cite{TOURAIN2016}). 
The ability to get accurate DORIS data relies for one part on the capability of providing 
accurate models to connect the  electronic RP (or electronic phase center) and the conventional 
RP, as well as, phase center variations (\gls{pcv}s) as a function of the elevation angle and azimuth.

The type of antenna is identified by the 4\textsubscript{th} character of the beacon 
mnemonic: letter ``A'' for the Alcatel type; letter ``B'' or letter ``C'' for the 
Starec B or C type.  That is, in the DORIS RINEX field ``STATION REFERENCE'', the 
last character of the second column (aka ``4-character station code''), defines the 
ground beacon antenna type; example:

\subsection{Phase Center Offsets}

Depending on the antenna type, appropriate \gls{pco}s need to be applied to 
the observed quantities for the reduction of the observation vector to the Reference Point 
(from the respective ``virtual'' phase center) of the antenna. When a linear combination 
of the observed quantities is used, a respective \gls{pco} needs to be computed and 
applied. E.g., for the case of the Ionospheric-free linear combination, the respective 
\gls{pco} is:
\begin{equation}
    \vec{r}_{2GHz,iono-free} = \frac{\vec{r}_{400MHz,2GHz}}{\gamma - 1}
\end{equation}

where $\vec{r}_{2GHz,iono-free}$ is the vector from the \SI{2}{\GHz} phase
center to the iono-free phase center and $\vec{r}_{400MHz,2GHz}$ is
the vector from the \SI{400}{MHz} to the \SI{2}{\GHz} phase center.

\subsection{DORIS STAREC Antenna}
STAREC antennae B and C are identical in terms of design and specification, the
difference is about the error budget in phase center position. For STAREC-C,
manufacturing process and error budget have been improved \cite{DORISGSM}.

According to \cite{TOURAIN2016}, in order to check the consistency of the theoretical 
characteristics of this type of antennae, a measurement campaign was performedby 
the CNES at the Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR). The CATR is a dedicated facility 
consisting ofan anechoic chamber equipped with several specific devices 
allowing significant measurement for satellite characterization.

As a result of the campaign, a phase law was established by averaging the estimated 
phase law values obtained during the CATR characterization. The resulting couple phase 
center positionâ€“phase law correction was provided to the  DORIS  users  through  a  
text  file  in  \gls{antex} (\cite{ANTEXv14}) format, available on the IDS website
\url{ftp://ftp.ids-doris.org/pub/ids/stations/doris_phase_law_antex_starec.txt}.

STAREC antennae B and C are identical in terms of design and specification, the
difference is about the error budget in phase center position. For STAREC C,
manufacturing process and error budget have been improved (\cite{DORISGSM}).
