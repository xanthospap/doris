# Atmospheric Models for Solar Radiation Pressure

## NRLMSISE-00

NRLMSISE-00[^1] is an empirical, global reference atmospheric model of the Earth 
from ground to space. It models the temperatures and densities of the atmosphere's 
components. A primary use of this model is to aid predictions of satellite 
orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. The model also predicts anomalous oxygen.
