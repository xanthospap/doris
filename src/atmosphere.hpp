/// @brief NRLMSISE-00 Model, 2001
/// The NRLMSIS-00 empirical atmosphere model was developed by Mike
/// Picone, Alan Hedin, and Doug Drob based on the MSISE90 model.
/// The MSISE90 model describes the neutral temperature and densities in
/// Earth's atmosphere from ground to thermospheric heights. Below 72.5 km
/// the model is primarily based on the MAP Handbook (Labitzke et al.,
/// 1985) tabulation of zonal average temperature and pressure by Barnett
/// and Corney, which was also used for the CIRA-86. Below 20 km these
/// data were supplemented with averages from the National Meteorological
/// Center (NMC). In addition, pitot tube, falling sphere, and grenade
/// sounder rocket measurements from 1947 to 1972 were taken into
/// consideration. Above 72.5 km MSISE-90 is essentially a revised MSIS-86
/// model taking into account data derived from space shuttle flights and
/// newer incoherent scatter results. For someone interested only in the
/// thermosphere (above 120 km), the author recommends the MSIS-86
/// model. MSISE is also not the model of preference for specialized
/// tropospheric work. It is rather for studies that reach across several
/// atmospheric boundaries.
